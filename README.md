# 🧙 Dungeon Crawler–Inspired RPG Leveling System

This project is a backend schema and foundation for a **stat-driven, class-based RPG** system inspired by *Dungeon Crawler Carl*. It combines elements of D&D with scalable leveling, infinite stat growth, skill-based progression, and an achievement system—all structured in a clean Supabase-compatible PostgreSQL schema.
